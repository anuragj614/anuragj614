## Hi there 👋 I'm Anurag

> *I build AI systems that actually work in production.*

🧑‍💻 AI Engineer based in Kathmandu, Nepal  
🤖 Specialize in Agentic AI, LLMs, and RAG  
⚡ Turned a 5–6 hour manual workflow into under 10 minutes with multi-agent AI

### 🚀 What I build

- **Agentic AI systems** with LangGraph — multi-agent orchestration, HITL workflows, checkpointing
- **RAG pipelines** — custom embeddings and intelligent retrieval
- **MCP servers** — custom tool exposure for AI agents (OCR, web search, and more)
- **LLM-as-Judge evaluation** — structured, criteria-based answer assessment pipelines

### 💼 Recent Work

- Architected a **multi-agent interview evaluation system** using RAG + LLM judges
- Designed a **business document generation pipeline** with LangGraph + AsyncPostgresSaver + HITL
- Reduced a **5–6 hour manual workflow to under 10 minutes** via a multi-agent orchestration system
- Built a **custom MCP server** with PaddlePaddle OCR for Japanese scanned documents
